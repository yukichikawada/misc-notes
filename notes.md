> a function that has variables defined within its scope that inner functions
> can use. Closures differ from callbacks in that cb's take functions are a
> parameter rather than creating the function internally.

How does CSS grid work?
> CSS grid follows component architecture methodology. Each html element
> becomes its own component if it `{display: grid}`. Child elements are either

> from the html to a css file.
